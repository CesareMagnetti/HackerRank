# HackerRank Practice Questions

This repo contains some of the practice questions HackerRank offers on its website. Will try to upload explanations for each exercise in the README files of each subdirectory time permitting.

## requirements

I used Python 3.8.2 for most exercises, download general requirements as 

```bash
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If any subdirectory will require specific environments/library they will be stated in the corresponding README files.
